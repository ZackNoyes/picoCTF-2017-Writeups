## Write-up
This was actually a pretty trivial problem. The problem with their code was the fact that the code directly called `system` but didn't manage to sanitize user input. To get shell, I simply used a quotation mark to get out of the `echo` statement. This is what I used to get shell: `echo aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"bin/cat flag.txt | shell2017.picoctf.com:16023`. The `a` and quotation will exactly fit the first row of the flag, so that our command of that second line looks something like this: `//bin/cat flag.txt` (the stuff at the end and the extra forward slash at the beinning were negligible).
