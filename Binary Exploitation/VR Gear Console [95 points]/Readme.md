# VR Gear Console - 95 Points
Here's the VR gear admin console. See if you can figure out a way to log in. The problem is found here: /problems/d07d574d3d27c5eeb03bce97956ef1c3

## Write-Up
First thing I tried was just disassemble the program to extract the password. However, the issue was the password was exactly 32 characters long, which would overflow into the username and it wouldn't let you login. 

Then, I realized the program had a simple buffer overflow that you can exploit in the username. Simply type in 16 characters in as username and then it would directly overflow into the `accessLevel` variable. This was my shell: `(python -c 'print "bof-fer!" + "!" * 8 + "\x01" + "\nhahaha! buffer-overflows-are-fun!"' && cat) | ./vrgearconsole`.
